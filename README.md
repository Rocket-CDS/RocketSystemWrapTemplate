# RocketSystemWrapTemplate

VS template to create a system which called another system

Example: RocketBusinessAPI

This project is used when we need to reuse code of a system with another systemkey, so we can run the same system multiple times on a webisite.  

It also offers a more understandable name when building web projects.
